# What you find on this Repository?
- Codes 
    
    
    Each Architecture is separated in a specific folder. We also have a "All_Codes.ipynb" with all the architectures inside
- Data Collected
    
    Plotting and Graphs
- Datasets
    
    
    Datasets divided on White Background, White Background Cropped and WHite Background Cut
    White Background: All the images of a snack with a white background
    White Background Cropped: Balanced dataset of 400 image each(This dataset was used for the data on the ppt)
    White Background Cut: No picture has a cut in between to avoid having to deal with the difference of cut food and non-cut food
- Models
  
  
    In here we store the models on h5 You only need to load the model to test the prediction. We only store the h5 files of Balanced dataset
- PPT
  
  
    Power Point Presentation
- Testing
  
    
    x_test of the balanced dataset

# What is this project about?


In our project, we created our own dataset of traditional Paraguayan snacks and used it to perform image classification using various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: AlexNet, LeNet, ResNet, VGG-16, and GoogLeNet. We compared the performance of these CNNs in terms of accuracy and image prediction on our dataset.
